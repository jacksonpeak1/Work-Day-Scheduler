## Description

This homework assignment was a great experience. I loved working more with local storage in javascript. I also really enjoyed working with bootstrap for the first time and I love forward to working with it more in the future. One of the other things I enjoyed introducing and working on in this project was moment in my javascript file. Overall I really enjoyed this topic, and I loved implementing all the new aspects that we've learned in the course so far.
